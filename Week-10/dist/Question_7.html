        <b> Steven Paul Jobs was born on February 24, 1955 in San Francisco, California.</b> His unwed biological
        parents, Joanne Schieble and Abdulfattah Jandali, put him up for adoption. Steve was adopted by Paul and Clara
        Jobs, a lower-middle-class couple, who moved to the suburban city of Mountain View a couple of years later.

        The Santa Clara county, south of the Bay Area, became known as Silicon Valley in the early 1950s after the
        sprouting of myriads of semi-conductor companies in the area. As a result, young Steve Jobs grew up in a
        neighborhood filled with engineers working on electronics and other gizmos in their garages on weekends. This
        shaped his interest in the field as he grew up. At age 13, he met one the most important persons in his life:
        18-year-old Stephen Wozniak, an electronics whiz-kid —and an incorrigible prankster, much like Steve himself.

            One of the last times I saw him, after I had finished writing most of
            the book, I asked him again about his tendency to be rough on people.
            “Look at the results,” he replied. “These are all smart people I work
            with, and any of them could get a top job at another place if they
            were truly feeling brutalized. But they don't.” Then he paused for a
            few moments and said, almost wistfully, “And we got some amazing
            things done.” Indeed, he and Apple had had a string of hits over the
            past dozen years that was greater than that of any other innovative
            company in modern times: iMac, iPod, iPod nano, iTunes Store, Apple
            Stores, MacBook, iPhone, iPad, App Store, OS X Lion—not to mention
            every Pixar film. And as he battled his final illness, Jobs was
            surrounded by an intensely loyal cadre of colleagues who had been
            inspired by him for years and a very loving wife, sister, and four
            children.
